# Yale Privacy Lab - Tracker Profiles

This repository contains research profiles on Android app trackers hidden in popular Google Play apps.  It also contains guides to help readers understand the advertising tracker business, including a list of acroynyms, a glossary of terms, and a list of Android app permissions.  Our release coincides with the excellent work of [Exodus Privacy](https://exodus-privacy.eu.org) on their Exodus privacy auditing platform.  Exodus is the first attempt at systematically auditing Google Play apps for the presence of tracker code, and the detailed descriptions here can now be integrated with the Exodus privacy auditing software.

Our documents will continue to be improved, and this is just the beginning of in-depth research into the wide world of tracker software inside mobile markets like Google Play and the Apple iOS app store.

Please see https://privacylab.yale.edu/trackers for the announcement of our work and a more detailed explanation.
