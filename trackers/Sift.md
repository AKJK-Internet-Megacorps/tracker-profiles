## About
More than 16,000 signals are analyzed by a service called Sift, which generates a "Sift score" ranging from 1 - 100. The score is used to flag devices, credit cards and accounts that a vendor may want to block based on a person or entity's overall "trustworthiness" score, according to a company spokeswoman.
LinkedIn, Airbnb, OpenTable, and Instacart are websites that serve up JavaScript versions of the tracker via https://cdn.siftscience.com/s.js
