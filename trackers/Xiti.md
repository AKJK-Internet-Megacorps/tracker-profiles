XiTi "many indicators of visitor activity: audience, navigation, origin of the visit, geolocation. Like similar services for commercial use, it tracks the return on investment (ROI) of marketing campaigns (e-mailing campaigns, sponsored links, contextual advertising) and measures the evolution of the turnover of a online shopping website". XiTi Free offers personal websites limited analytics for free, whereas XiTi Pro "is intended for showcases or small sites, especially for SMEs / SMIs. It offers a first professional evaluation of the performance of a website" [Wikipedia, 01, translated from French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/XiTi).  

"To use XiTi on a given page you must add in its source code a marker in the form of a JavaScript script that will allow the company's servers to access the information to be saved (based on the headers of which Cookies , the IP address , and the JavaScript environment). An alternative is to insert a small logo (visible for the free version and invisible for paid versions) on each page to be audited." [Wikipedia, 01, translated from French](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/XiTi)

_AT Analytics Dashboard:_  

* "Build Dashboards: Understand and drive your business at a glance! Create digital analytics dashboards that can be customised down to the pixel and shared across your company."

_Explorer Service:_  

Explorer's "iterative analysis...means giving analysts – whether they are beginners or experts – the ability to gradually access data, by first offering an intelligent analysis recommendation system based on machine learning, and then offering the ability to slice and dice the data as much and however they wish. Our objective here is simple: offer these users a tool which will help them find the value in their data, step by step, and then help them share the data so that the most can be made of it. To that end, Explorer offers tools that let you work with and refine your data indefinitely notably via filters, drill-downs, on-the-fly segmentation, and custom cross-calculations.  

...with just one click, the analyst can access Data Query to extract data via our API, and then activate that data by creating relevant retargeting campaigns, for example.

The analyst can also transform the analysis into a KPI to be directly displayed in a dashboard, thanks to Explorer’s integration in the Analytics Suite. This KPI will allow business users to understand what’s happening, follow the KPI’s evolution, and potentially implement actions as a result." [Ad Internet, 03](https://blog.atinternet.com/en/interview-finding-the-value-in-your-data-step-by-step)  

_Mobile developments:_  

"There are also mobile features that continue to be developed. For example, we are working on the analysis of the customer journey, which is now done on several devices. This cross-device tracking is simple in theory, because in practice, it's more complicated than just following log-in users ... Above all, unlike others, we are very concerned about the respect of Internet users, and everything must be done with their consent, in accordance with the law. We have many other features in preparation. We will also work on marking and its reliability, a "smart SDK" for mobile apps, a tool to know the traffic pages and links by surfing the site, or a benchmark mobile apps using data from the app stores."

We only keep:  

* IP address data for 6 months maximum  
* [Learn more about how we process and anonymise IP addresses.](https://www.atinternet.com/en/company/data-protection/data-collection-on-our-customers-sites/#geolocation)
* GPS location data for 6 months maximum  
During collection, we truncate all GPS coordinates to two decimal degrees – we never collect GPS coordinates in their entirety. Truncated  coordinates  are  then  converted  into  a  heatmap  graphic  providing  country-level-only  informa-tion. Full details are never displayed. 
* Our cookies are active during a fixed period of 13 months, and are then deleted from a user’s computer AT Internet’s cookie only contains a unique alphanumeric ID – no other data is stored in the cookie." 

_Transparency:_ "The GDPR requires companies and organisations (“data controllers”) to be completely transparent, “using clear and plain language”, when informing end users (“data subjects”) about which personal data is collected, where it is stored, and for how long it is kept (see previous section)."  

"... AT Internet has the resources required to retrieve, edit or erase any personal data in a timely manner. We will liaise directly with end users on this matter when necessary. We communicate clearly and transparently about end users’ rights in our
privacy policy. We also offer an opt-out option for end users who do not wish their activity to be tracked via our web analytics solution."   

_Storage Location:_  

"AT Internet processes and stores all personal data within the European Union, with no personal data being transferred outside the EU. This information is clearly accessible in our privacy policy, and in our customer contracts."  

_Co-Responsibility:_ "Under the GDPR, when two different organisations (“data controllers”) work together to establish the purpose and means of processing personal data, they are considered “joint controllers” and share responsibility. Joint controllers must together determine the details of their “respective responsibilities” for GDPR compliance, especially as it relates to their duties in responding to data subject requests."

"... AT Internet’s Analytics  Suite is GDPR-compliant. We therefore commit to sharing full responsibility with our customers for any potential privacy breaches and sanctions under the GDPR. We will provide each of our customers with a contract addendum – a Data Protection Agreement, or DPA – to precisely define the scope of responsibility.

Your visitors’ data should NOT be used in other ways for which they have not given consent."  Data profiling requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) " to determine how this profiling affects the protection of your users’ personal data."  

"... With AT Internet, you always remain the owner of your data. We never use or merge our customers’ analytics data for our own purposes. We do not carry out any profiling activities, and in light of the GDPR, we strongly encourage our customers and prospects to carefully
