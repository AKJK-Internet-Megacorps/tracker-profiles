## Products and Services
Crashlytics offers a variety of services for app developers. Crashlytics:

* Receives and analyzes app crash reports which may contain user and device-specific data.

* Performs analytics on app logs "even the exact line of code your app crashed on" [Crashlytics, 03](https://fabric.io/kits/ios/crashlytics).

Google's "Answers" analytics product can be installed by app developers via the Crashlytics tracker SDK [Fabric, 02](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/overview.html) or manually [Fabric, 04](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/installation.html). Answers is "the analytics engine" of Fabric [Answers, 01](https://answers.io), Google's mobile platform. With Google Fabric, clients can:

* Perform analytics on app users and utilizes social media advertising: "Get insight into your users, what they’re doing, and inject live social content to delight them" [Fabric, 01](https://get.fabric.io).
* Perform cross-device user identity and authentication via "Fabric" [Wired, 01](https://www.wired.com/2014/10/twitter-fabric-sdk).

* _Understand_ users:
* * _Engagement_ to "Get insight into your users, what they’re doing, and inject live social content to delight them."
* * _Retention_ to "Uncover behaviors that correlate with healthy and unhealthy users."
* _Grow:_
* * _Monitor_ "new user sign-ups" to "optimize your onboarding flow."
* * _Revenue_ services to "Easily monetize your app with ads" [Fabric, 05](https://get.fabric.io).

"While Crashlytics gives you powerful crash reporting," Google states, "with one additional click you can enable real-time analytics that help you understand what’s happening in your app" [Fabric, 03](https://docs.fabric.io/android/crashlytics/overview.html). Answers:

* Gives clients "real-time statistics on how your app is being used, including active user numbers, session length, stability rating, and retention. 
* Gives clients "instant metrics as soon as you turn it on, without requiring any additional code" to "dig deeper into user behavior and engagement by logging Answers Events" [Fabric, 04](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/installation.html).
* _Event Tracking_ "gives you the ability to track the specific actions and events in your app that matter most. You can now see how users are behaving in your app and surfacing that critical information in real-time". This tracking is capped at "a maximum of 3,000 distinct events per app." [Fabric, 06](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/answers-events.html).
* _Audience Insights_ integrate with "Twitter’s robust audience insights data set to tell you the key demographics and interests of your user base." The "Top Interests show you the most common interests for your entire user base. The Top Differences highlight the interests that make your user base different from a typical user for the Audience Insights data set. The map, which you can pan and zoom to see different regions of the world, shows the top locations in the world where your users are interacting with your app" [Fabric, 07](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/audience-insights.html).
* Users can enable _Converstion Tracking_ via Fabric to track conversions [Fabric, 08](https://docs.fabric.io/android/answers/mobile-app-conversion-tracking.html).
