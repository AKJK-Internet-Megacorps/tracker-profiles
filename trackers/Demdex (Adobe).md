# Adobe (Demdex)

## Demdex history
In 2011, Adobe acquired Demdex for $109 million [Crunchbase, 01](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/demdex). Demdex offered a "behavioral data bank" for advertising purposes. The data bank was used for audience segmenting, and could be plugged into ad servers or services, giving websites and advertisers control over the data. DemDex was added to Adobe's "Online Marketing Suite" (powered by Adobe-acquired Omniture) [TechCrunch, 01](https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/18/adobe-buys-behavioral-data-management-platform-demdex).
