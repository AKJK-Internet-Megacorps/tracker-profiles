# ScorecardResearch

About: "ScorecardResearch, a service of Full Circle Studies, Inc., is part of the comScore, Inc. market research community, a leading global market research effort that studies and reports on Internet trends and behavior. ScorecardResearch conducts research by collecting Internet web browsing data and then uses that data to help show how people use the Internet, what they like about it, and what they don’t." [SCR, 01](https://www.scorecardresearch.com)  

Methods: "ScorecardResearch collects data through from two main sources: surveys and web tagging. For our surveys, we invite people on the Internet to provide us with anonymous demographic and Internet usage information that we can use to refine our reporting. These surveys are always voluntary, and are never used to collect personal information. For web tagging, participating websites agree to deploy a special code throughout their sites. Again, no personally identifiable information is ever transmitted by, or linked to, the web tags." [SCR, 01](https://www.scorecardresearch.com)  

_Data collected:_ "... Through the practices described above, we may also collect data about your Web browsing and mobile app usage behavior over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, and provide this data to third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes" [SCR, 03](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)"  

In 2012, ScorecardResearch was the third-biggest name in The Guardian's "Tracking the Trackers" data set [The Guardian, 01](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/23/scorecardresearch-tracking-trackers-cookies-web-monitoring).  

_Regarding mobile technology, they say:_    

"As part of ScorecardResearch’s market research effort, participants agree to deploy ScorecardResearch web tags throughout their site. These tags send a message to ScorecardResearch that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be dropped or a mobile identifier to be accessed... mobile identifiers (where relevant) to help participants count users who have visited and seen a page or various parts of a page" [SCR, 03](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)  

_Sharing with 3rd parties & mobile:_  

SCR data collection and sharing: "ScorecardResearch may use a third party service provider to obtain non-personally identifiable information and add that data to our measurements. Either ScorecardResearch or the third party service provider may initiate the process which results in this association, and this process may involve ScorecardResearch triggering the dropping of a cookie belonging to the third party service provider. We may also associate the anonymous unique identifier within the ScorecardResearch cookie on your computer or device with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies) using confidential matching procedures.
