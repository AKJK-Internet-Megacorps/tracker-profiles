## Products and Services
_Data collected:_ "... Through the practices described above, we may also collect data about your Web browsing and mobile app usage behavior over time and across digital properties, including information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, and provide this data to third parties to use for their own interest-based advertising purposes" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)"  

ScorecardResearch provides a limited description of its services online. Some of the data listed on its website may be outdated or in need of an update. For example, there is little mention of mobile solutions: "ScorecardResearch collects data through from two main sources: surveys and web tagging. For our surveys, we invite people on the Internet to provide us with anonymous demographic and Internet usage information that we can use to refine our reporting. These surveys are always voluntary, and are never used to collect personal information. For web tagging, participating websites agree to deploy a special code throughout their sites. Again, no personally identifiable information is ever transmitted by, or linked to, the web tags." [ScorecardResearch, 01](https://www.scorecardresearch.com)  

## Privacy Policy
_Sharing with 3rd parties & mobile:_  
SCR data collection and sharing: "ScorecardResearch may use a third party service provider to obtain non-personally identifiable information and add that data to our measurements. Either ScorecardResearch or the third party service provider may initiate the process which results in this association, and this process may involve ScorecardResearch triggering the dropping of a cookie belonging to the third party service provider. We may also associate the anonymous unique identifier within the ScorecardResearch cookie on your computer or device with information obtained from other sources (such as consumer preference reporting companies) using confidential matching procedures" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)

_Mobile privacy:_    
"As part of ScorecardResearch’s market research effort, participants agree to deploy ScorecardResearch web tags throughout their site. These tags send a message to ScorecardResearch that causes a ScorecardResearch cookie to be dropped or a mobile identifier to be accessed... ScorecardResearch uses the combination of tagging,cookies, and mobile identifiers (where relevant) to help participants count users who have visited and seen a page or various parts of a page" [ScorecardResearch, 02](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/privacy.aspx)

_Self-regulation:"  
"comScore supports the goals of the Digital Advertising Alliance, which has introduced Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. comScore requires companies that place our tags on their webpages to include a notice that its sites or applications use cookies or other identifiers that collect anonymous traffic data, and that these cookies or other identifiers may be placed by the website or by a third-party who provides services to the web site. comScore's tags are used for market research; they are not used for behavioral advertising" [ScorecardResearch, 03](https://www.scorecardresearch.com/Principle.aspx)
