## Products and Services
_Solutions for publishers:_ Ad Server / Programmatic / Mobile / Video / Ad Formats [Smart, 04](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/holistic-ad-server)  

_Full stack ad technology platform:_ Smart is a full stack ad technology platform: "We come to work because we want to solve the biggest problem publishers, advertisers and agencies face in online advertising — control. It’s simple. When other companies sell and resell your ad inventory and data through various parties, you depreciate your company’s value along the way. Smart’s integrated ad server and RTB+ Solution allows you to maintain control over your valuable media assets. We provide you with one robust engine to drive your revenues at any scale. Your ad server is the core of your business. It’s your most important strategic asset. It’s that much more powerful when it is seamlessly integrated with RTB+ and can handle the monetization and delivery of any kind of ads – display, rich media, video – on any platform – web, mobile web or mobile apps" [Smart, 05](http://smartadserver.com/what-we-do/our-mission).  

_Holistic Ad Server:_ "One integrated platform to run your entire advertising business, including direct and programmatic campaigns, across all digital formats and screens. Optimize operations without losing time switching between platforms... As the central piece of the puzzle, the ad server gets the big picture. It can optimize the value of each impression by taking absolutely all parameters into account in real time allowing direct sales to compete with programmatic ones. The platform dynamically allocates ads by incorporating all activity on the network: traffic and inventory forecasting, delivery planning, guaranteed campaign commitments, offers, and targeting parameters" [Smart, 04](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/holistic-ad-server).  

"The Smart AdServer full stack platform features both an ad server and an SSP. From a single entry point, you can manage all your revenue sources: direct, programmatic and ad network mediation. Our outstanding holistic yield optimization algorithm ensures that each impression is sold through the best sales channel in order to maximize your overall revenue" [Smart, 06](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/full-stack).

* Cross-platform delivery

_Premium Programmatic:_ "Our cross-platform, cross-device, cross-channel technology is 100% independent, 100% publisher-focused and easy-to-use. Access top quality buyers via an SSP integrated into the ad server."  This can:

1. Deliver premium ad campaigns (for rich media, native ads, and video)
2. Manage any type of deal (open auction for unreserved inventory; direct deals of fixed-price unreserved inventory; private auctions for buyers; and guaranteed deals with same options as for direct campaigns)
3. Regain full control of your inventory (granular control over RTB rules, including transparency level of your inventory, setting floor prices, and block-lists; quality monitoring utilizing smart machine learning, 3rd party tools, transparency reports, and a creative control interface)
4. Optimize your advertising revenue (manage all of your revenue sources - direct, programmatic, and ad network mediation - from a single interface).  A holistic yield optimization algorithm ensures impressions sold through the best sales channel to maximize revenue; an RTB+ Dashboard offers analytics for insights and revenue decisions; Smart AdServer teams to consult; and Smart Yield+ to optimize rules and price floors [Smart, 08](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/premium-programmatic).

_RTB Mobile:_ Deliver relevant mobile ad experiences, using rich media templates so "you can create a campaign even if you don’t have stellar technical skills" [Smart, 09](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/mobile).

### Methods
Cookies & Web Beacons are used (including pixel tags) [Smart, 02](http://smartadserver.com/company/privacy-policy)

"Sites and Advertisers are using the system to manage the delivery of their online advertising campaigns. They can collect anonymous statistical data on their visitors to follow the delivery of their campaign and to increase their performance. We may also collect information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit a site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads depending on your browser configuration. Online measurements are compiled and anonymous. They essentially relate to Internet advertising campaign exposure: the number of impression of a banner, the number of clicks or the number of visitors having seen the campaign. Some statistics may relate to the performance of the campaign (‘return of investment’). In addition to that, Smart AdServer may use cookies to provide advanced statistical data." [Smart, 02](http://smartadserver.com/company/privacy-policy)

_Mobile:_  
1. _Location targeting based on:_ device type; connection type; location through geotargeting; SDK version; screen size; any sales channel; geofencing ("Use GPS positioning to pinpoint your target audience based on proximity to a location").  

2. Prefetch: Deliver ads to users when offline (eg, during commute)

3. Viewability: "Measure the number of viewable impressions and define viewability settings based on parameters such as location and area of ad exposure."

4. Reporting and forecasting: "Get real-time campaign statistics as well as accurate and reliable forecasts based on date, media type, operator, brand model, location and more."

5. Showcasing: "Showcase apps by previewing ad on actual devices before it goes live" [Smart, 09](http://smartadserver.com/publisher-platform/mobile)
