_Full stack ad technology platform:_ Smart is a full stack ad technology platform: "We come to work because we want to solve the biggest problem publishers, advertisers and agencies face in online advertising — control. It’s simple. When other companies sell and resell your ad inventory and data through various parties, you depreciate your company’s value along the way. Smart’s integrated ad server and RTB+ Solution allows you to maintain control over your valuable media assets. We provide you with one robust engine to drive your revenues at any scale. Your ad server is the core of your business. It’s your most important strategic asset. It’s that much more powerful when it is seamlessly integrated with RTB+ and can handle the monetization and delivery of any kind of ads – display, rich media, video – on any platform – web, mobile web or mobile apps." [Smart, 05](http://smartadserver.com/what-we-do/our-mission)

"Sites and Advertisers are using the system to manage the delivery of their online advertising campaigns. They can collect anonymous statistical data on their visitors to follow the delivery of their campaign and to increase their performance. We may also collect information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit a site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes or showing certain ads depending on your browser configuration. Online measurements are compiled and anonymous. They essentially relate to Internet advertising campaign exposure: the number of impression of a banner, the number of clicks or the number of visitors having seen the campaign. Some statistics may relate to the performance of the campaign (‘return of investment’). In addition to that, Smart AdServer may use cookies to provide advanced statistical data."

2. Prefetch: Deliver ads to users when offline (eg, during commute)

3. Viewability: "Measure the number of viewable impressions and define viewability settings based on parameters such as location and area of ad exposure."
